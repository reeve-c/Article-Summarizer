      " Michael Keaton has always been my Batman, because, despite my enjoyment of the Adam West TV series, by the time that film came out, I really got Batman . I may not love the films (and I have no issue with anyone who did), but I got the world-weary Batfleck . From the first images and trailers for \"The Batman,\" it seemed like we were getting \"emo Batman,\" and while that sounded fun, that isn't at all what we have here . A dark avenger (sorry Marvel) is an archetype that we can find in any culture and it speaks to us on a very deep level . Robert Pattinson isn't playing emo.  He's dealing with intense PTSD, as so many of us do.  It's something most adults can relate to.  I think the decision to take this out of the Snyder continuity was an important one . Matt Reeves' \"The Batman\" gives us a hero who needs to take down criminals . He can trap a gang in a subway and pummel the hell out of them with no remorse . Film and storytelling at its best is a vehicle for us to vent the anger, rage, frustration, and horror we feel right now . This is no traditional comic book villain, spinning riddles and doing silly things . This is Joker-level villainy at its darkest . \"The Batman\" speaks to the terror we're all feeling right now, and also gives us a gritty crime drama that is both thought-provoking and cathartic . \"The Batman\" is the best Batman for the times we're living in . Keaton and the subsequent fun Batman films were simple and entertaining . The \"Dark Knight\" films were darker because the world was.  The Batfleck films were a fantasy world where superheroes could come and save us .\n"
